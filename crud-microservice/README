Python CRUD Microservice

    This proyect contains a microservice developed using:
    * Python as Back End languaje, 
    * Flask module to set the service and endpoints
    * H2 Database
    * MySQL Database (The credentials must set in 'mysql.py' and the data source must meet certain requirements)

    If there is any module that is not installed, please ensure to install it using the following commands:

        * Flask:            pip install flask
        * Sqlalchemy:       pip install flask_sqlalchemy
        * Mysqldb:          pip install flask_mysqldb

    To run this service, navigate to the proyect root directory and run the following command:

        * python main.py

    After running the last command, the service will run and be ready to serve requests. The CRUD operations
    are abailable on the following endpoints:

    H2 database: 

        * CREATE:           POST        localhost:8008/api/h2/users/
        * READ (All):       GET         localhost:8008/api/h2/users/
        * READ (By Id):     GET         localhost:8008/api/h2/users/<id>
        * UPDATE:           PUT         localhost:8008/api/h2/users/<id>
        * DELETE:           DELETE      localhost:8008/api/h2/users/<id>

    MySQL database: 

        * CREATE:           POST        localhost:8008/api/users/
        * READ (All):       GET         localhost:8008/api/users/
        * READ (By Id):     GET         localhost:8008/api/users/<id>
        * UPDATE:           PUT         localhost:8008/api/users/<id>
        * DELETE:           DELETE      localhost:8008/api/users/<id>

    To use the MySQL service, it is essential to have MySQL installed, a database called 'usuarioscrud' 
    and a table called 'usuarios' with the following structure:

    +----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | id       | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | nombre   | varchar(30) | NO   |     | ''      |                |
    | edad     | int(11)     | NO   |     | 15      |                |
    | locacion | varchar(40) | NO   |     | ''      |                |
    +----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

    To use the web view of the CRUD service (this page is set to show the H2 database information)
    just follow the next URL: http://localhost:8008/ 
    The web view contains a table that show all the users stored in the database as well as controlls
    to do all the CRUD operations.
